# GCP
Google Cloud Automation Code
The following code pushes csv from GCS to BigQuery using:
1. local folder containing datestamped marked csvs (to extract table schema and column names)
2. GCP bigquery Rest API in Python 
3. GCP "bq" command line tool

To get an idea on how code operates, have a look at the code flow diagram.
